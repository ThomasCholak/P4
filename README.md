<b> Program Translation Project </b> 

This project was create in order to produce a compiler which translates from one coding language to another. The way this is accomplished is by feeding
input code into a lexical analyzer which differentiates between keywords, variable names, digits, and operands. The lexical analyzer creates a series
of tokens which are then read into the below BNF:

![P2BNF](https://github.com/ThomasCholak/CodeCompilationProject/assets/63080803/4e4800d3-f245-44f1-a657-cbc8f1568d87)

Using this BNF structure, P4.cpp then builds the a parse tree using a preorder traversal.

Here is an example input code:

![inputcode](https://github.com/ThomasCholak/CodeCompilationProject/assets/63080803/67c9eede-d640-4720-b5f8-09b77e45ef83)

This will produce the following tree (however this is not shown to the user):

Then, following the same example, the below .asm file will be generated using the aforementioned input code:

We can then run this code on the following website: https://comp.umsl.edu/assembler/interpreter

After being 'ran' this will then prompt the user for user input (in this example I used '4') and then display the following:

<b> How to Run </b>

To run this project, you will have to import the files <i>Makefile</i>, <i>P4.cpp</i>, and <i>P4.h</i> into a Linux.

Upon running the 'make' command to run the Makefile, the <i>comp</i> executable will then be generated.

We can then run <i>./comp</i> and then enter the name of the file, which will create a '.asm' file with the same name:

However, if no file is entered then it will request user input instead and then generate a file named 'a.asm' instead:

![aasm](https://github.com/ThomasCholak/CodeCompilationProject/assets/63080803/434dd586-e468-4f10-989d-82330f8a471e)

We can then run the 'vim' command to view the generated code and then copy and paste the code into the aforementioned website
in order to run our newly generated code (as shown previously).

<b> How does this program work?</b>

Essentially, the way this program works is the input code is parsed into tokens with the 'lexer' function.

These token types are then parsed into the BNF structre in order to produce a valid tree. If an input code is not valid
then an error will be produced into the console and no output code will be returned. Else, the tree will be produced
and then this code will be implemented into the 'generateCodePreorder' which uses the 'TreeNodes' (found in the header file)
type and value in order to create the corresponding output to the console.
